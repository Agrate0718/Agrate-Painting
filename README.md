## Description
A website for purchasing a catalog of paintings and requesting custom made to order painting

### Approach Taken
I plan to be using miro to flesh put my Wireframes and a vs code extension for my Erd's. Im then going to go into this to get the front end done as quickly as possible so the style can be up to review for the person that this project is for. Afterwards then I'll work on all neccessary funcionality like buttons and forms, and then backend api and db's.

### Tech
Ts,MERN stack, and Tailwind

<!-- ### Wireframe -->
